# Create Google Web Stories using AMP and HTML 
Web stories are an immersive, tappable and easily shareable storytelling format. Web stories are built using the AMP Framework.
The amp-story component provides the AMP story subset of AMP. It is the base technology for web stories.
# Use AMP Components:
Google Web Stories heavily rely on AMP, which is a framework designed for fast-loading web pages. Utilize AMP HTML components like <amp-img>, <amp-video>, and <amp-story-page> to create your story pages. AMP ensures that your stories load quickly and smoothly on mobile devices.
